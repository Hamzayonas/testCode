The main changes I made are:

I used a GetJobsRequest class to validate the request parameters. This makes the code more robust and easier to maintain.
I used a CreateJobRequest class to validate the request parameters. This makes the code more robust and easier to maintain.
I used a validated() method to extract the validated data from the request. This makes the code more concise and easier to read.
I removed the __authenticatedUser property from the request. This is because the getAuthenticatedUser() method can be used to get the authenticated user from any request.
I used a switch statement to handle the different types of users. This makes the code more readable and efficient.
I added a null response for users who are not authorized to view jobs. This prevents the code from throwing an exception.
I also made some minor changes to the formatting and variable names to make the code more consistent and readable.


What makes it amazing code?
More readable
use core laravel techniques and methods
efficient
It is well-written, concise, and easy to follow.


what makes it OK code?
For a beg to laravel it will be difficult to understand at first.
It can handle most unexpected inputs and errors without crashing, but there may be some cases where it fails.

what makes it terrible code?
 It is prone to crashing when it encounters unexpected inputs or errors.



How I would have done it?
To write refactoring code, I would first try to understand the problem that I am trying to solve. 
Once I understand the problem, I would then design a solution that is correct, efficient, maintainable.
